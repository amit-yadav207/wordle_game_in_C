# Wordle Clone in C

## Project Title
Wordle Clone in C

## Description
This is a famous Wordle game that I simulated in C language. The game has three levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The system chooses a random 5-letter word, and the user guesses that word in a few attempts to get a score. There is a clue section and a virtual keyboard to display which letters are used, which letters are not in the random word, and which letters are guessed correctly. The information is stored in a file as a scoreboard.

## Features
- Three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard
- Random 5-letter word selection
- Clue section to assist the player
- Virtual keyboard displaying letter status (used, not in the word, guessed correctly)
- Scoreboard stored in a file
